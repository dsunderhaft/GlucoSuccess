COPD Research is a unique iPhone application that utilizes [ResearchKit](https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit) and HealthKit to get a more accurate understanding of how various things affect the progression and management of COPD. The app presents a variety of surveys and tasks to track health behaviors such as physical activity, diet and medications.
