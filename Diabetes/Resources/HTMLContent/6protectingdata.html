<p>We take several steps to protect your privacy and the privacy of your  app data. </p>
<p>To certify that you consent to participate in the study, the app asks you to enter your name and an email address. This allows study investigators to have a record of who participates in the study, and to email a copy of the signed consent form to you. </p>
<p> Your name and email are <em>only</em> used for the consent process, and are not associated with data collected from the app. </p>
<p>App-generated data is associated only with a random study code, and this code is stored completely separately from any personally identifying information. </p>
<p>These steps ensure that researchers analyzing the coded study data  will not be able to  connect it to  any individual user.</p>
<p>Whenever app data is transferred to a research study computer, it will be encrypted so that others cannot interpret the data or associate it back to you. </p>
<p>Encrypted app data (stripped of personal identifiers, and associated only with a random code) will be       sent to secure data servers used for the RADSResearch research study that are maintained by Dash Trials (<a href="http://www.dashtrials.com ></a>). VirtualClinicalTrials is a non-profit
  organization dedicated to the advancement of science by making available to the scientific community secure computing and database architectures.
</p>
<p>Study investigators chose Dash Trials for this important responsibility because they are a world leader in the secure storage and protection of sensitive research data. They have a proven track record of safeguarding and managing potentially sensitive biomedical data in accordance with regulations that govern human research and medical information (e.g., regulations mandated by Institutional Review Boards [IRB] and the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]).</p>
