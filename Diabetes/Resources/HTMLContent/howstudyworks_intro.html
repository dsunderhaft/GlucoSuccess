  <h1>How the Study Works</h1>
        	<p>RADSResearch has several user-friendly features:</p>
              
              <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
              <li><boldie>Automated way to collect your medical record information:</boldie> </li>
        	  <li><boldie>Log your health behaviors:</boldie> we’ll ask you to use the free “Lose It!” app to track your diet. Survey questions will periodically ask you about taking your medicines, how you are sleeping, lipoma and fat inspections, and your overall quality of life.</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Track your physical activity:</boldie> your iPhone’s accelerometer will do this automatically for you! Just remember to carry your iPhone with you (e.g., in your pants pocket, or a holster clipped to your waist).</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Insights into your adipose disorder control:</boldie> RADSResearch uses visualizations and text summaries to display how your diet and physical activity affect your RADs. RADSResearch also gives you insights into your food choices.</li>
           		</ul>
        	<p>RADSResearch encrypts your data, separates it from your identity, and adds your data to a secure research database. This will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and lab values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers better understand the complex relationships between diet, exercise, and activities for people with a rare adipose disorder. It will also help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research. </p>
        	<p>Because RADSResearch is both an app and a research study, we will explain the risks and benefits of the study as part of an informed consent process.</p>
