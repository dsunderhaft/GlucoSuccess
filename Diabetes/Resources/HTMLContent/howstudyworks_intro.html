  <h1>How the Study Works</h1>
        	<p>MyHealth has several user-friendly features:</p>
              
              <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
              <li><boldie>Automated way to collect your medical record information:</boldie> </li>
        	  
        	  <li><boldie>Track your physical activity:</boldie> your iPhoneâ€™s accelerometer will do this automatically for you! Just remember to carry your iPhone with you (e.g., in your pants pocket, or a holster clipped to your waist).</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Insights into your COPD control:</boldie> MyHealth uses visualizations and text summaries to display how your diet and physical activity affect your COPD. COPD also gives you insights into your food choices.</li>
           		</ul>
        	<p>MyHealth encrypts your data, separates it from your identity, and adds your data to a secure research database. This will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and lab values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers better understand the complex relationships between diet, exercise, and activities for people with a rare adipose disorder. It will also help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research. </p>
        	<p>Because MyHealth is both an app and a research study, we will explain the risks and benefits of the study as part of an informed consent process.</p>
