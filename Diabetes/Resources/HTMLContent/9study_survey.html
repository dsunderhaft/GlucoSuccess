<p>RADSResearch will  collect some of its data on your health behaviors through short survey questions, such as:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
  <li>Over the past week, did  you take some or all of  your  medications?</li>
  <li>How frequently you used compression, whole body vibration, lymph pumping, etc...?</li>
  <li>Did you inspect your lipomas today?</li>
</ul>
<p>Occasionally, there will also be longer surveys that evaluate aspects such as your quality of life, or your sleep duration and quality.</p>
<p>For dietary information, RADSResearch will ask you to use the free &ldquo;Lose It!&rdquo; app to log what you eat for meals.</p>
<p>In general,  more data entered  into the app results in  more accurate and informative  personalized insights .</p>
