 	<p>RADSResearch  provides personalized insights into how your health behaviors relate to Rare Adipose values, to help you manage your disease. In general,  richer data  entered  into the app results in  more accurate and informative  insights.</p>
<p>To drive these insights, RADSResearch will ask you to: </p>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
  <li>Answer survey questions about your lipedema, dercums, FML or Madelungs conditions (described more in a subsequent screen)  </li>
  <li>Collect your lab values</li>
  <li>Log what you eat, as best as you can. We will ask you to log your meals using the free app &ldquo;Lose It!&rdquo;, which will provide nutritional information to RADSResearch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The app  sends  occasional reminders to  complete study activities.</p>
