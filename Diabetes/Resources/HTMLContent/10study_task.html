<p>RADSResearch will also ask about some information that requires a brief task away from the iPhone, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Going to your local lab and having blood drawn for lab tests</li>
  <li>Your weight</li>
  <li>Your waist circumference (occasionally)</li>
</ul>
<p>RADSResearch provides personalized feedback in the form of g raphs and text to display your progress, and provide insights into your health behaviors. These insights may help you understand your health behaviors better, and help you manage your adipose disease. Viewing the graphs and text is optional but may be useful or interesting to you.</p>
<p>For the passive sensing of your physical activity to be accurate, it&rsquo;s important to carry your iPhone on your person (e.g., in your pocket, or clipped to your waist).</p>
<p>In your Profile within RADSResearch, you can set   reminders for yourself to  complete app activities. In general,  more data  entered  in the app results in  more accurate and informative  insights.</p>
