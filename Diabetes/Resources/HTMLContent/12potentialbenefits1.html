<p>One of the biggest challenges for people with a RADS is tracking diet, exercise and other health behaviors. RADSResearch may help by streamlining these daily tracking tasks.</p>
<p>RADSResearch will also provide personalized insights and feedback to help you understand how your health behaviors can influence your RADs values. This may help you manage your RADs.</p>
<p>More generally, patients with a RADS may ultimately benefit from this research, because RADSResearch and its research study will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and RADs values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers better understand the relationships between diet, exercise, and activities in real-world people with RADs. It will also help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research.</p>
