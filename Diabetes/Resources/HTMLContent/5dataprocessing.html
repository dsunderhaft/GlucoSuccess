<p>COPD Research helps you keep track of health behaviors important for people with COPD, such as physical activity, diet, and taking your medicines. Data that you share through the app as part of the research study will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors, lab, genetic and imaging values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers understand how health behaviors influence RADs in real life, with a resolution greater than ever before. (Traditionally, these studies are done by asking people to fill out very long questionnaires on paper every few years.) </p>
<p>At the same time,  MyHealth analyzes your data to provide personalized insights into how your diet and physical activity relate to your lab values, and helps you manage your COPD.</p>
<p>By combining a personal app and a research study, MyHealth will help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research. </p>
