<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We take several steps to protect your privacy and the privacy of your app data.<br />
</p>
<p>As we have described above, your identity will be separated from your app data and kept as confidential as possible. Your app data will be associated only with a randomized study code that bears no relation to any identifiable information. Only select individuals that are part of the research study will know the identities of people who participate in the study.</p>
<p>One potential loss of privacy would be if someone sees RADSResearch on your iPhone and then suspects that you have diabetes.</p>
<p>For security, RADSResearch requires that your iPhone be protected either by a passcode or the Apple TouchID fingerprint sensor. This ensures that only you can enter and use the app.</p>
