	  <p>RADSResearch  uses the iPhone&rsquo;s built-in accelerometer to passively keep track of physical activity (&ldquo;passive&rdquo; because this happens automatically and you do not need to enter any information). The app interprets accelerometer data as steps taken, or as different intensity levels of activity.</p>
      <p>For these  activity measures to be accurate, you should carry the iPhone on your person as much as possible (e.g., in your pocket, or clipped to your waist). For instance, if the iPhone is resting on a table when you go for a walk, it will not be able to detect this activity.</p>
