   <p>Welcome to RADSResearch! This app is part of an exciting new program to use the iPhone to advance clinical research into rare adipose disorders (RADs), while also helping you manage your RADs. </p>
   <p>RADSResearch helps you keep track of health behaviors important for people a Rare Adipose Disorder (RADs), such as physical activity, diet, and taking your medicines. Data that you share through the app as part of a research study will help researchers understand how health behaviors influence RADs in real life, with a resolution greater than ever before. At the same time, the app provides personalized insights into how your daily diet and physical activity relate to your RADs lab values, and helps you manage your RADs better. </p>
